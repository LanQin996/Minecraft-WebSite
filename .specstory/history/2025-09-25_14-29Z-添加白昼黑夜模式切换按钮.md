<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing theme toggle**

I need to add a dark/light mode toggle to the top navigation and align that button to the right. I’ll modify layouts/default.vue to include the theme toggle and update the CSS to reflect the changes. I should also look into persisting the theme selection. In Nuxt 3 with Vue, we can implement this with useColorMode, but I’m not sure if the @nuxtjs/color-mode package is installed. I need to check package.json and nuxt.config.ts for confirmation.</details></think>

---

I'll scan the config and package files to see if a color mode module is available, then update `layouts/default.vue` to add a right-aligned theme toggle and supporting styles.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing a theme toggle**

I'm thinking about a toggle button to switch between light and dark modes. Maybe I could use Element Plus's `el-switch` and add icons like sun and moon. It's important to keep it simple, so I might just use text '🌙/☀️'. 

First, I'll fix the `global.css` by changing `::root` to `:root`. Then in `default.vue`, I should create a reactive `theme` state, read from localStorage, and set up a button in the header that toggles styles while keeping layout adjustments in mind.
**Adding a theme toggle button**

I'm planning to add a button with the class `theme-toggle` and set its margin to auto for positioning. First, I’ll place it after the navigation inside the header. To adjust spacing, I’ll add margin to both the nav and the button. I need to ensure the button has minimal CSS styling and follow the indentation rules.

Before I implement the changes, I should create to-do items per the tool's specifications. I’ll note that I need to fix the global CSS root and set up the theme toggle in `default.vue` with persistence. Then, I’ll proceed with the edits and status updates.</details></think>

---

I'll add two tasks: fix CSS variables root and implement a persistent theme toggle aligned to the right in `layouts/default.vue`. Now I'll update `assets/global.css` and `layouts/default.vue`.

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [-] Fix :root selector and ensure CSS variables support light theme
- [ ] Add persistent light/dark toggle in layouts/default.vue and align right

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing button alignment**

I need to implement the button aligned to the right. Currently, the header has a brand and navigation. To achieve this, I’ll add a div spacer with a flex:1 property to push the button to the far right while keeping the navigation on the left. The plan is to wrap the navigation and spacer to ensure that the button ends up at the right edge. I'll also use minimal styles for the button, possibly using Element Plus for consistency.
**Implementing theme toggle functionality**

I’m setting up the template for the header, which includes a brand, navigation, a spacer, and a theme toggle button. The button will change themes based on user preference, utilizing local storage for persistence. I’ll check for the saved theme on mounting and apply it accordingly. I'll also configure the HTML attributes dynamically based on the theme for server-side rendering. Plus, I need to ensure the styles are applied correctly, like using `.spacer` for flex alignment, and keep the code's indentation consistent.
**Preparing for file edits**

I’ve noticed the file uses a consistent two-space indentation, so I’ll stick to that. Next, I need to edit the file and mark the todo as complete afterward. It's crucial that I don’t break any types since I’m using TypeScript in the script setup. I’ll make sure to leverage `process.client` as it’s available in Nuxt 3/4, and I should import `useState`, `computed`, and `useAsyncData`, which have already been utilized in the file. Let’s get started!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Rearranging navigation links**

We need to adjust the layout of the navigation links in the header. Right now, the order is brand, nav, spacer, and theme toggle. To move the nav to the right, I can place the spacer after the brand and before the nav and toggle group. This will effectively reorder the DOM to brand, spacer, nav, and toggle. I should also consider adjusting spacing, ensuring there's a gap between nav and toggle. A wrapper or margin-left for the toggle might help when it's next to nav.
**Implementing styles and updates**

I plan to add `.theme-toggle { margin-left: 12px; }` to ensure there's proper spacing between elements. This change is small, so I don't need to create any todos for it. I’ll implement these edits and make sure to provide a status update according to the specifications. It feels straightforward, so I’ll go ahead and proceed with applying the patch. Let’s get this done efficiently!</details></think>

I'll move the flex spacer before the nav so both “首页/后台” and the theme toggle align to the right, and add a small left margin to the toggle for spacing.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Extending theme support**

I see that we need to extend theme support for components like HeroSection.vue and pages/index.vue, especially for colors. We have CSS variables ready, so the components should use them, like var(--bg) and var(--fg). I should read those files and track this with our to-do list. I’ll make todos to audit styles and replace any hardcoded colors. It might be useful to check layouts/admin.vue for headers too, possibly using a parallel approach.</details></think>

I'll scan homepage components to find hardcoded colors and update them to use CSS variables so light/dark themes apply consistently.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating homepage components**

I need to ensure our homepage modules are compatible with the theme. The `HeroSection.vue` has hardcoded gradient colors and buttons, which is problematic. The `index.vue` file also has conflicting hardcoded colors with another `.hero` style. Plus, it defines styles for a `.hero` section that isn’t used in the template, which may be legacy. I should replace hardcoded backgrounds and colors with CSS variables and adjust the gradient to use CSS variables, including opacity tokens.
**Modifying background styles**

I need to simplify the styles by modifying the bound style to use CSS variables for colors, but I realize that CSS variables don't work easily in gradients. I could use a linear gradient with an overlay approach instead, perhaps using a `background: linear-gradient(180deg, var(--panel) 0%, #...)`. For the light theme, a heavy dark overlay might look odd, so I’ll consider using a semi-transparent `rgba` overlay in dark and light themes. I must ensure text and buttons use their respective CSS variable colors. Additionally, I’ll update the `index.vue` styles for consistency.
**Implementing changes for HeroSection**

For `HeroSection.vue`, I’m planning minimal changes. I’ll update the inline style to only use a background image and shift the overlay gradient to CSS using variables. I’ll create a style block for the hero background image, utilizing `hero.bg_url`, but I think keeping the inline binding is okay. I can change the gradient colors to use CSS variables with opacity, possibly using a simpler semi-transparent overlay based on the theme. This will help maintain compatibility across browsers and maintain clarity in the code.
**Updating component styles**

I need to adjust the component CSS by setting `background-color: var(--panel)` and using `background-blend-mode: multiply` to darken the image effectively. If I apply the background color and image together, I need to consider how it might appear in both light and dark themes. To simplify things, I could keep the gradient but use CSS variables to define fixed opacities. It might make sense to add overlay colors in `global.css`, creating specific variables for dark and light themes for compatibility. Let’s implement that!
**Implementing adaptive gradients**

I’m planning to update the `HeroSection.vue` inline styles to incorporate variables for gradients and text colors. I'll use `var(--fg)` for text colors and `var(--primary)` for buttons, along with `var(--border)` for the ghost button border. Also, I'll clean up duplicate hero styles in `pages/index.vue`, as the page doesn't actually use the `.hero` class. After that, I’ll update section colors to these variables and add overlay variables in `global.css`, followed by modifying the components and running lints to finalize everything. Let’s get started!</details></think>

---

I'll add theme-aware overlay variables in `assets/global.css`, update `components/HeroSection.vue` to use these variables for gradient and button/text colors, and switch `pages/index.vue` styles to CSS variables so the homepage respects light/dark mode. Then I'll check for linter issues.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating homepage compatibility**

I need to tackle the homepage's compatibility issue since the colors in the default layout for the header and footer are hardcoded. Right now, I see that `default.vue` has fixed colors, so I should switch to CSS variables.

I'll ensure the body background uses `var(--bg)` and update the header's background to `var(--panel)` with opacity, while also addressing text colors and borders. The footer and HeroSection need similar updates. I'll implement these changes in `default.vue`, keeping the backdrop blur intact.
**Updating CSS for compatibility**

I need to adjust the CSS to improve compatibility for the homepage, particularly the header and footer. I’ll apply variables for borders and colors, like using `border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border)` for navigation links and changing the footer background to `var(--panel)`.

The container text color will match the default body color. I’ll decide on keeping the green for the brand or adapting it. I also need to ensure the hover background is a color mix, and I’ll implement these changes in `layouts/default.vue`.
**Running tools and updates**

I need to provide a status update since I’m using tools. I’ll summarize the process at the end, which will help clarify things for the user. Regarding the todo list, since this task is small, I think I can skip it because the previous todo list was already completed. Now, I just need to run the apply_patch and perform some lints to ensure everything is working smoothly! Let’s get this done!</details></think>

---

I'll update `layouts/default.vue` styles to use theme variables for header/footer and nav colors, so the homepage fully responds to light/dark mode, then check for linter issues.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating UI styles**

I’m considering the light mode panel background, sticking with solid white for the header and using a gradient overlay based on variables. The button colors will remain fixed in green, paired with dark text, which should work well. I'm noting that the ghost border may have compatibility issues due to color-mix. I also want to ensure that styles in various components, like HeroSection.vue, leverage CSS variables, while also addressing the default styles in internal content classes. The header background change to `var(--panel)` from rgba should help as well.
**Implementing translucency variable**

I’m thinking about creating a variable for translucency using color-mix, which would help maintain it independently of the theme. Mixing `var(--panel)` with 85% transparency would yield a nice translucent white with a blur effect in the light theme. I’ll also change the `.theme-toggle` background from hardcoded colors to variables. It's important to update the `layouts/default.vue` style, ensuring that `.site-footer` has a plain `var(--panel)` background without translucency. After that, I’ll proceed with applying patch updates and maybe adding `--panel-alpha` to `assets/global.css`.</details></think>

---

I'll refine the header to use theme-aware translucent background and update the toggle button styles to use CSS variables so light/dark mode applies uniformly across the homepage. Now making the edits in `layouts/default.vue` and then checking for linter issues.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing admin functionality**

I need to set up the backend and admin features. The project has an admin page that references components like AdminProfileForm.vue and AdminSidebar.vue, which are currently missing. There are existing server APIs. I want to create these components, using Element Plus and CSS variables. 

The admin layout imports AdminSidebar.vue from layouts/admin.vue, so I must create that file too. The profile form will fetch the current username and allow changes, while the hero form will prefill with the current hero's info. I’ll ensure the forms call the appropriate endpoints for profile and hero updates.
**Creating admin sidebar and forms**

I need to set up the AdminSidebar.vue component since it's referenced in layouts/admin.vue and the mobile drawer. This page uses AdminSidebar with an el-menu for the mobile layout. Also, I need to ensure the styling of these components aligns with theme variables while keeping it minimal to meet the request. 

I'll implement AdminProfileForm.vue, which will include a card with an el-form, inputs for username, password, and confirmation. For AdminHeroForm.vue, I need to fetch the current hero details and allow editing, including a preview image with a background gradient. I'll be using PUT requests to save changes.
**Implementing AdminSidebar**

I need to create the AdminSidebar.vue component, which will accept a prop for "collapsed." In layouts/admin.vue, this prop is passed to AdminSidebar, while the mobile version won't use it. So, I'll implement the props as `collapsed?: boolean = false`.

The sidebar should render an el-menu with items linked to /admin?tab=profile and /admin?tab=hero, ensuring navigation upon selection. I’ll also make sure to use theme variables for styling. Once that's done, I’ll proceed to create the files and check for any linter errors.</details></think>

I'll create the missing admin components (`AdminProfileForm.vue`, `AdminHeroForm.vue`, `AdminSidebar.vue`) to make the backend admin features work, wired to existing API endpoints. Then I'll run a lint check on the new files.
