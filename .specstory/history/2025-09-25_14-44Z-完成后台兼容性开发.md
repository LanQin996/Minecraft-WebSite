<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning backend completion**

I need to ensure compatibility for both PC and mobile devices. This involves completing the backend by implementing the admin layout and components, along with necessary server endpoints.

I noticed some components like AdminProfileForm.vue and AdminHeroForm.vue are missing, and the admin layout only references default.vue. I’ll need to create layouts/admin.vue and those components. I also need to wire up server APIs and add middleware, update the global.css, and modify pages/index.vue to fetch the hero and include the HeroSection component. 

I’ll use todo_write for planning and apply_patch for implementation. Finally, I’ll check for linter errors and inspect the server files for API contract.</details></think>

There are also missing components. I want to implement those components along with responsive CSS and check the admin-protect middleware. Additionally, I’ll examine the relevant endpoints and remaining files to ensure everything is set up correctly.</details></think>

I'll quickly inspect the remaining server endpoints, middleware, layout, and missing components to see what's incomplete, then I'll create the admin layout and the two admin form components with responsive styles.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning admin backend updates**

I need to complete the admin backend and ensure it works on both PC and mobile. I see that the current admin.vue uses Element Plus components, but I haven’t found AdminProfileForm.vue or AdminHeroForm.vue yet. Also, I might need to check nuxt.config for Element Plus. The pages/admin directory is empty, but I have admin.vue at the root. I’ll need to create the missing components and layouts properly to avoid errors, and I should also think about updating the CSS for responsiveness.
**Updating admin page styles**

I think it’s better to focus on improving the admin page style block without altering the existing content in admin.vue, except to add a style section. I also need to include Element Plus, but it seems I'm missing the proper setup in Nuxt 3. Since running npm isn't ideal here, I might consider using native inputs and a minimal CSS drawer instead. However, I could replace the el- components completely, modifying admin.vue significantly, which seems like a practical way to reduce dependencies.
**Checking Element Plus usage**

It seems the el components are already in use, which suggests the intention to use Element Plus is there. I should review package.json to confirm if Element Plus is listed among the dependencies. This might help me understand how it’s integrated into the project and whether I need to set it up or make adjustments accordingly. I want to ensure everything is functioning as expected with the existing setup!</details></think>

I need to remember to add scoped styles in admin.vue or update the global CSS since they used class names. It's also important to confirm that the server endpoints exist, like profile.get.ts, which should return "ok" and the username, and ensure that profile.put.ts, hero.put.ts, and hero.get.ts are all implemented. Lastly, I'll check that the middleware is protecting the /api/admin route. Now, let’s read through nuxt.config.ts.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Completing admin backend**

I need to focus on completing the admin backend while ensuring it works well on both PC and mobile. There are references in the code, like `AdminProfileForm.vue` and `AdminHeroForm.vue`, but I need to create these components and the admin layout. It seems that while there’s a mobile drawer, there’s no button to open it. I need to implement responsive CSS classes, adapt elements for mobile, and create the necessary components that call the API for user profiles.
**Developing admin components**

I noticed `profile.get.ts` checks cookies and returns the username, which is good! Next, I need to create `components/AdminHeroForm.vue` with fields for title, subtitle, and background URL, and integrate it with the API for fetching and updating the current hero. 

I should also create `layouts/admin.vue` that includes a mobile hamburger menu to open the drawer. While the current header might remain, I can ensure the layout offers a responsive container. Finally, adding global or scoped CSS styles for admin elements is necessary to enhance the layout's responsiveness.
**Implementing admin styles and components**

I’m planning to add styles to `pages/admin.vue` and create the two missing components along with a layout file. To keep organized, I'll set up todos and follow tooling rules using `todo_write`. Then, I'll implement updates via `apply_patch`. 

I want to add a mobile-only button to open the drawer in the header, since right now it only has a logout option. The Element Plus components are auto-imported, which simplifies things. 

Also, I’ll ensure the server endpoints are protected and check the layouts directory to add the new `layouts/admin.vue` for a minimal wrapper.
**Creating todos for linter checks**

I need to create todos to address linter errors after implementing the changes. It’s important to keep track of these tasks so that I don't overlook any issues that might arise. I'll make sure to check the code thoroughly and fix any errors flagged by the linter to maintain code quality. Having these todos written down will help keep everything organized and ensure the project stays on track. Let's get those added!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Summarizing project status**

I need to give a status update and summary now that we've implemented the files. It might be a good idea to suggest running the dev server with the command `npm run dev`. I can confirm that all tasks are checked off, according to the completion spec. Additionally, I should mention the responsive design improvements, like the mobile drawer and media queries. We also used Element Plus, which is already installed, but I need to ensure the admin layout emits the toggle-drawer correctly.
**Updating admin layout functionality**

In the admin layout, the `menu-btn` emits 'toggle-drawer,' but the pages won't catch this unless using a named slot due to how events propagate. Since the layout is the parent of the page, custom events can’t change the child’s state directly. I could simplify by removing the emit since we already have a menu button in the page header. Plus, I've confirmed that Element Plus components are available via the installed module. I'll provide a concise status update, suggesting to run `npm run dev`. Code references might be needed.
**Finalizing the summary**

I think we can skip including the code in the summary and instead focus on giving a concise overview. It's important to present a clear summary so the user can easily grasp the key points without getting bogged down by technical details. Once I wrap everything up, it should be straightforward and easy to understand. So, I’ll work on finalizing this summary effectively!</details></think>

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating admin layout**

I’m looking to modify `layouts/admin.vue` by removing the navigation and brand elements. The user clearly stated not to show the top navigation in the admin layout, so it makes sense to implement that. I’m considering whether to keep a minimal title bar, but it seems best to remove the header entirely to streamline the layout. Pages that are specific to the admin already include their own header, so let's proceed with those changes and then provide a status update.</details></think>

I'll remove the header and any frontend navigation from the `layouts/admin.vue` so that admin pages no longer show the site's top navigation.

_**User (2025-09-25 14:45Z)**_

后台导航放到左侧侧边栏。pc端的时候默认打开，移动端也需要适配

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering layout adjustments**

I need to shift the backend navigation to a left sidebar, which should be open by default on PC and adaptable for mobile. The current admin page has a sidebar for desktop and a drawer for mobile, which seems to meet the requirements. However, it sounds like the user might want the sidebar integrated into the layout rather than just the page. I could enhance the admin layout to include a collapsible left sidebar that all admin pages share while still managing internal tab logic through the admin page.
**Evaluating sidebar integration**

To centralize navigation, I’m considering moving it into the layout, possibly using provide/inject or slots. Actually, it might be simpler to keep admin.vue as it is, but since the header was removed, I need to make sure the left-aligned sidebar occupies space, which it does. The mobile drawer can still be accessed via the menu button. The sidebar is desktop-only and is meant to be visible by default. It seems the user may want it in the layout for better reuse, so I’ll work on implementing that.
**Revising sidebar functionality**

I think I can keep the sidebar within the layout and include navigation items for 'profile' and 'hero.' I can communicate the selected tab to the page via the route query, which admin.vue already uses. This way, the layout will handle the sidebar and drawer menu, allowing links to change the query. I’ll remove the sidebar and drawer from admin.vue to prevent duplication. I also need to add a fixed top bar with a menu button in the layout since users prefer the navigation integrated there.
**Designing mobile header**

I’m planning to add a simple, small header with just a menu button for mobile. Earlier, the user requested not to show the frontend top navigation, but this is more of an admin-specific minimal header, which should be fine. I’ll update admin.vue to remove its existing header, sidebar, and drawer, and only keep the content forms and possibly a sign-out button. The layout will handle the drawer state and be able to open it with the menu button, which will be added to the layout instead of the page header.
**Implementing admin layout changes**

I’m planning to create a layout with a small admin bar that includes a menu button and possibly the brand "后台." The user previously asked not to show a frontend top navigation, but they didn't specifically forbid an admin top bar, so that should be fine. I’ll make changes in layouts/admin.vue to add state detection for the mobile drawer and provide a sidebar with buttons linking to the query parameter updates. In pages/admin.vue, I’ll remove the existing sidebar and menu button, adjusting the layout to show just the content while allowing the route query to control the tab selection.</details></think>

---

I'll move the admin navigation into the left sidebar within the admin layout so it's shared and always visible on PC, and accessible via a drawer on mobile. I'll also clean up `pages/admin.vue` to remove its own sidebar/drawer and rely on the layout for navigation, ensuring the tab state is driven by the route query.

---

Tool use: **apply_patch**

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating layout for admin pages**

I've updated the layout to include the sidebar and need to clean up pages/admin.vue by removing its own sidebar and drawer, since the layout now handles that. I will ensure that the page only renders forms based on the query tab, keeping the definePageMeta layout for admin. After login, I wonder if we should keep the header from earlier. The admin layout's top nav shouldn’t appear, but I'll decide whether to keep a minimal logout button. Removing the sidebar duplication is essential as well.
**Refining admin page structure**

I need to remove the sidebar and drawer from the admin page and update the content to rely on the current tab from the route query. The layout already manages navigation with the query, so I can compute the 'tab' instead of watching for changes. I’ll edit pages/admin.vue to simplify it by removing sections like the aside, drawer, and unnecessary imports. I want to keep login inputs while ensuring the page reads directly from the route without its own navigation.
**Implementing edits and updates**

I’m ready to implement the necessary edits, and I need to remember about status updates and the todo list. We’ve completed previous todos, but there’s a new change that isn't logged. Since the tool requires todos for multi-step tasks, even though this is a small edit, I’ll make sure to provide a brief status update before each tool call. I’ll start with the status line for the apply_patch on pages/admin.vue, simplifying it as planned. After this, I won't run any optional lints but will summarize what we've done.</details></think>

---

I'll remove the page-level sidebar and drawer from `pages/admin.vue`, and drive the current tab purely from the route query to align with the new layout sidebar.

已将后台导航移入左侧侧边栏，并在布局内统一管理：
- PC 端：左侧侧边栏默认显示。
- 移动端：顶部显示菜单按钮，点击打开抽屉导航。
- `pages/admin.vue` 移除了自身的侧栏/抽屉，只通过 `query.tab` 切换内容，保持与布局一致。

现在访问 `/admin?tab=profile` 或 `/admin?tab=hero` 可直接定位对应模块。

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating layout adjustments**

I’m thinking about adjusting the layout so that the sidebar doesn’t take up the area meant for the top header. The admin layout removed the top header to create a grid, but it seems like the internal top bar might still be present. The user indicated that the sidebar overlaps with the navigation area, possibly expecting the default header to remain. In the admin layout, I should keep the internal header separate, as it’s sticky within the content. I need to figure this out!
**Revising header layout**

I’m noticing that the header is currently within the content area, while the sidebar is next to it. The user’s complaint suggests the sidebar is encroaching on the top navigation area. It seems they want a dedicated header in the admin layout for both the title and logout above the sidebar and content. I think I can resolve this by moving the `admin-header` into the layout. This way, the sidebar won’t overlap, and I can include a slot for any necessary header actions.
**Implementing header adjustments**

I'm thinking we should create a simple header that includes a title and a spacer, but the logout action will still be tied to the page. The user wants the sidebar to avoid overlapping with the top navbar, so I’ll place a top bar container above the grid, visually reserving 48-56px in height. I’ll add a `<div class="admin-header">` for the mobile menu button and an optional slot for header items. 

Next, I'll modify the `layouts/admin.vue` to include this header and remove the existing header in `pages/admin.vue`, along with any related CSS.
**Applying updates and providing status**

I need to apply the necessary patches and also include a brief status update as instructed by the developer. There's no requirement for a to-do list since this is a small change, just a simple implementation. Once I apply the patches, I’ll make sure to summarize the changes at the end. It’ll be straightforward, but I want to ensure everything is clear for the user! Let's get this done smoothly.</details></think>

I see we added a top bar to the admin layout but need to remove the header from pages/admin.vue. The user mentioned the sidebar is taking up space needed for the top nav. However, the page still has a header with a logout button, which duplicates the top bars. Although the user wanted to hide the frontend nav in admin, they might still want the logout button accessible. I’ll check pages/admin.vue to see if we're still keeping the admin-header with the logout. It looks like we need to confirm what’s currently in the file.</details></think>

I need to respond with minimal verbosity but still include a status update about using tools. The user expects a fix for the sidebar occupying the top bar. We added a layout header, but the admin.vue still has a duplicated header. The user pointed out the sidebar issue, so we need to remove the header block from pages/admin.vue to avoid duplication. Applying a patch to remove that section and related CSS seems like the way to go. Let's proceed with editing!</details></think>

I see the page still has its own top header, which conflicts with the new fixed top bar in the admin layout. I'll remove the page-level header and its styles so the sidebar no longer affects the top region and the layout's top bar is the only header.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Adjusting layout for sidebar**

I need to refine the layout, particularly the sidebar. It should be sticky to the top under the header, and full-height without any gaps. It's also possible that the left column width is causing some blank space at the top. I must ensure the sidebar fills from below the header to the bottom, eliminating any padding that might create gaps. Additionally, I should check the display settings for mobile and desktop and ensure proper button alignment in the sidebar.
**Refining admin shell padding**

I need to adjust the .admin-shell padding to 16px on all sides, but they want to eliminate any empty space on the left. It seems there might be a grid gap causing that issue. I plan to set the sidebar to sticky at the right height. Instead of 72px, I think 64px will be more consistent. Since the header height is 56px plus additional padding, I’ll set the sticky position to prevent overlay, likely at 72px.
**Improving header and sidebar layout**

I should set a fixed height of 56px for the .admin-header and add padding-top of 16px to the .admin-shell. This way, the sidebar will start just below the header at 72px. They’ve mentioned avoiding any blank space on the left, so I need to ensure the sticky sidebar eliminates that gap. I can achieve this by adjusting the padding on the .admin-shell to 0 at the top, ensuring the sidebar reaches the header. Additionally, I’ll set the sidebar height to fill the viewport without leaving blanks.
**Modifying layout styles**

I want to update the CSS for layouts/admin.vue. First, I’ll set the .admin-shell's padding-top to 0. The sidebar will be positioned as sticky at the top of 56px, filling the viewport height minus the header. This way, it’ll have auto overflow for vertical scrolling. I also need to ensure there's no extra gap in the content area, so I’ll add a margin-top of 0 too. It looks like the changes are straightforward, so I don’t need a to-do list—I'll just apply the patch!</details></think>

I'll make the sidebar sticky below the admin header, remove the top padding so there's no empty space, and set the sidebar to fill the viewport height with vertical navigation.

I need to reply with a confirmation and a brief summary while keeping it concise. Since we used the apply_patch tool, I should include a small status update and a summary. I already provided a status update before the tool call. 

Now, in the final message, I should confirm the change to vertical navigation with buttons stacked, no extra top padding in the content column, and ensure the header height remains sticky at 56px. I'll create a concise statement about these adjustments.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Adjusting admin layout CSS**

I need to adjust the admin layout CSS to ensure the sidebar is flush with the left edge. Right now, the .admin-shell has padding and gap causing extra space. The sidebar's border-radius might be okay to keep, but we can remove that for a truly flush look. I'll set the padding-left of .admin-shell to 0 and adjust the margins. We should also remove any unnecessary border radius to eliminate gaps, since the user wants everything tight against the side!
**Updating admin layout styles**

I need to change the .admin-shell to have padding set as 0 on the left. The grid gap only affects column spacing, so that’s not an issue. The header currently has padding, but it’s okay for that to remain, as long as the sidebar stays flush left. I also need to adjust the mobile media query to eliminate left padding. Lastly, I’ll ensure there’s no margin on the body since that’s already set to zero. I’ll apply these updates to the styles now!
**Crafting a status update**

I need to create a concise status update that follows the specifications. Even though the final answer might be short, I must ensure that I include updates for each tool call since that's part of the requirements. It's important to have a brief line before each type of tool call in the commentary messages. Once I have everything ready, I’ll present the outcomes and summaries in the final channel. Let's go ahead and apply the patch!</details></think>

I need to make sure each button in the sidebar occupies the full width and is displayed one per row. Right now, they’re arranged in a flex column with gaps, but they might not be styled as block-level, full-width elements. I'll change the layout in `layouts/admin.vue`, setting the sidebar button to `display: block` and `width: 100%`. It's essential to avoid wrapping buttons horizontally, especially in mobile views; I need to revise this to fit the user’s request for one button per line.

I need to change green accents to a blue gradient. I see green used in several styles: the default layout brand color, button backgrounds, and some message colors.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Resolving input width issues**

I need to address the input width change caused by the Element Plus suffix icon on hover to maintain a fixed width for the login form and prevent layout shifts. In `pages/admin.vue`, the `.login.card` has a max-width of 360px, but the clear icon on hover can alter the width. The solution might involve adjusting the CSS for the inputs, ensuring their wrapper has a set width and a reserved space for the icon. Using specific CSS properties to manage visibility and dimensions should help avoid these layout problems.
**Adjusting input styles**

I’m working on fixing the input widths by setting `el-input { width: 100%; }` and ensuring the `.el-input__wrapper` has a `padding-right: 36px` to account for the clearable icon. I thought about using `visibility: hidden`, but that makes the icon invisible at all times, which isn’t ideal. Instead, I’ll set a fixed width for the suffix and adjust other properties to handle the layout without shifting. Applying these CSS updates in `pages/admin.vue` should help ensure a consistent appearance and user experience.
**Confirming username input settings**

I see that the username input field is set to `clearable: true`, which is good to know. This means users can easily clear their entered text if needed. I’ll proceed with adjusting the settings and styles accordingly to ensure everything works smoothly together. I want to make sure that the layout remains stable while implementing this feature. So, I'll keep this in mind as I move forward with the updates!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering layout issues**

I'm thinking about how the admin header might be overlapping content because of the sticky positioning. The content has a padding top of 0, while the header is 56 pixels high, which might hide part of the content if I don't add a margin-top. Since the header is sticky rather than fixed, it takes up some space, so that's okay. I've noticed that the button colors aren’t matching the dark theme well, and this could lead to readability issues.
**Adjusting layout styles**

I’m thinking we should remove the outer centering on the page level and just rely on the layout itself. For the .auth-page styles, I’ll eliminate the min-height of 100vh and remove the centering properties, letting the layout take care of centering. I’ll set the width to 100% and max-width to auto. Also, inputs should have a consistent height, so I might set the .el-input__wrapper's min-height to 44px. Lastly, I’ll check the styles in pages/admin.vue for any needed adjustments.
**Refining style adjustments**

I'm thinking about simplifying things by removing or adjusting any unnecessary redeclarations. I should get rid of the :root block to avoid duplicating variables that are already defined globally. This will help streamline the code. Also, I want to improve the focus ring by setting the outline to none, which should be fine for accessibility. Next, I'll go ahead and implement these edits to clean things up and enhance the overall styling.</details></think>

I need to adjust the styles for AdminProfileForm and AdminHeroForm to ensure they fill the right content width. The pages/admin.vue section might have a max-width set or fixed card styles affecting width. While AdminProfileForm.vue doesn't set a max-width, the label-width of 88px could limit content fill. The user feels the modules are too small. I wonder if the .auth-form’s max-width of 520 is restricting post-login content, and if parent layout padding and styles might need reevaluation too.
**Adjusting components for full-width**

It looks like the page might be using .auth-card styles only for login, which shouldn't affect the admin forms. To achieve full-width, I can set the .card width to 100% and change the label position to the top on mobile devices. For both AdminHeroForm and ProfileForm, I'll add styles to ensure the .el-form has a max-width of 100% and that input fields are full width. Also, I want to set padding in pages/admin.vue to zero to avoid unnecessary space since the user mentioned the modules feel too small. I'll proceed with these updates!

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing content layout**

I need to adjust the content container's layout in `pages/admin.vue` to ensure it fills the right area. The layout's `admin.vue` uses a grid with defined spaces and padding, while `pages/admin.vue` has its own padding and potential max-width limits. I notice conflicts because both use the section class "content." The layout's content container is already wrapping the slot, so perhaps I shouldn't include another wrapper in the page section to avoid issues with nested padding causing width limitations.
**Refining content structure**

I need to simplify the content structure in `pages/admin.vue` to ensure it fills the space correctly. I could either remove the extra section and render components directly or rename the class to avoid CSS collision and unnecessary padding. One option is to replace `<section class="content">` with `<div class="admin-content">` and set the width to 100%. Alternatively, I could remove the wrapper completely and adjust the scoped styles to eliminate any overriding padding from the layout. Let's make these updates accordingly.</details></think>

I’m working on fixing the mobile sidebar toggle for the admin layout. The header has a menu button that should open the drawer when clicked, but it always renders, which is confusing. The `isMobile` guard is set to show only on mobile and when the user is authenticated, but there’s still a problem with its visibility when clicking. The detection of whether it’s mobile is happening too early. I need to check if user state is affecting the drawer visibility when clicked.
**Diagnosing mobile sidebar issues**

After login, I noticed that the mobile menu button is set to display only in the header with the command `@click="drawer = true"`. We removed the page header before, so now the layout header is showing. There's a class conflict where `.mobile-only` is set to `display: block` in one place and `display: none` in another. The user reports clicking doesn’t show the sidebar, which might be due to the drawer being overlapped by content because of z-index issues. The default drawer should have a high z-index, so I need to check that.
**Implementing responsive updates**

I’m considering that the menu button activates the drawer when set to true, but `drawer v-if="isMobile && authed"` means `isMobile` is only computed once. If the screen is resized after mount, it won’t update correctly, especially in desktop dev tools when it initially loads as desktop. I think it would be better to use `addEventListener` for real-time updates. I’ll set `isMobile.value` based on the matchMedia for responsiveness and check if we need to adjust breakpoints consistently between 768px and 1024px.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Fixing mobile sidebar issue**

I need to address the problem where clicking the menu button on mobile isn’t showing the sidebar. The menu button is in the header and relies on being mobile and authenticated to trigger the drawer. I think the isMobile detection may only run onMounted, which could cause issues if the user’s not authenticated. The real issue seems to be that the el-drawer requires the Element Plus plugin to work correctly, especially in the Nuxt environment. I’m questioning if the button click is being fired properly.
**Examining mobile drawer behavior**

I’m looking at the mobile-only menu button in the header, which is hidden on desktop and shown on mobile using CSS. The drawer should only be visible if the user is authenticated, so I need to ensure that the 'authed' property is true. Clicking the button on mobile doesn’t seem to open the drawer, and I’m wondering if the event might be blocked by z-index issues. The drawer is supposed to append to the body, but if isMobile isn’t updating correctly, it could cause problems after a resize.
**Exploring menu button issues**

I’m considering the menu button's behavior, which should always be visible, but if the user isn't authenticated, clicking it doesn't activate the drawer. This might be why they reported that the sidebar button doesn’t show on mobile when they’re logged in. Another point is that the Element Plus Drawer opens correctly from the left. I realize I need to align the isMobile computed value with a 1024px breakpoint rather than 768px, as this might be causing the drawer not to render properly on tablets.
**Implementing viewport updates**

I’m thinking about adding a resize listener to update the isMobile value when the viewport changes. I’ll implement an event listener and include proper cleanup to avoid any memory leaks. I’ll focus on patching the layouts/admin.vue file to change the matchMedia query to 1024px and ensure that the drawer opens correctly using the drawer=true toggle. This should enhance the responsiveness of the menu, making everything work more smoothly on different devices. Let’s get started on this!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Ensuring drawer functionality**

I need to ensure that the drawer doesn’t auto-open. The default setting for it is `false`, which means it shouldn’t open on login. However, I’ve noticed that on mobile, the sidebar is desktop-only. The drawer should only show when the user is mobile and authenticated, but I’m realizing that showing the sidebar means the drawer panel could still be visible. I’m thinking the drawer might be set to open because of states from previous sessions or clicks. I'm puzzled!
**Analyzing sidebar behavior**

I’m considering whether the `el-drawer` could appear as true due to the `v-model` not being initialized properly. It’s supposed to start as `false`. Alternatively, maybe the sidebar is always showing on mobile despite the CSS meant to hide it. It looks like the admin-shell grid might reserve space for the sidebar even when it’s hidden. The grid's columns remain allocated, causing an empty gap that looks like a sidebar. That's why it seems like there's a sidebar!
**Updating grid and drawer visibility**

I need to adjust the grid to a single column on mobile using the existing media query for the admin-shell. It looks like we're already setting that up! The left padding is zero, which is fine for mobile. I’m wondering if the `el-drawer` is visible by default. It should be closed unless triggered by actions, and we can set the `:model-value` properly. The user’s complaint suggests that the desktop-only class isn't being hidden correctly due to the breakpoint confusion, meaning adjustments are necessary for the mobile condition.
**Fixing sidebar and drawer issues**

The sidebar has the class `desktop-only`, which is supposed to hide it on mobile, but it might still be occupying grid space. When an element has `display:none`, it shouldn’t throw a gap in the grid, yet the drawer still appears open. I need to ensure the drawer is set to `false` when the user logs in or when the mobile state toggles. I’m planning to use a watcher on `authed` and `isMobile` to manage this. Plus, I’ll apply the `destroy-on-close` property to prevent retaining state. Let's set it up!
**Implementing layout changes**

I’m planning to make some changes to the `admin.vue` layout. To start, I’ll need to apply the necessary patches to `layouts/admin.vue`. This should help improve the overall functionality and design.

I need to respond with a concise message, including a status update since the developer spec requires it when using tools. It's important to summarize as well. We made changes to ensure the drawer only opens on click, whereas before it opened automatically. We added a "destroy-on-close" feature and set the initial state of the drawer to false. However, we might need to reset it after login. There seems to be some confusion about default behaviors and mobile detection. I’ll make sure to clarify that.
**Updating drawer state on auth change**

I think when authentication changes to true on login, we should definitely set drawer to false. In the layout, I can watch `adminAuthed` to close the drawer. It seems I haven't done that yet, so I’m considering performing another patch. I’ll use a `watchEffect` to ensure that `drawer.value` is set to false whenever authentication changes or the route updates. I also need to prevent it from opening automatically. I’ll add the necessary code and provide a concise confirmation once complete.</details></think>

**Creating admin component**

I'm setting up the admin component for system settings, including fields like site title, subtitle, description, logo URL, and icon URL. I want to include a preview of the logo and icon, plus a save function via PUT /api/admin/site. Initially, I'll fetch values from either /api/admin/site or /api/site. I need to update the layouts/admin.vue to add navigation for "系统设置" with a new tab for 'system.' I'll ensure proper conditional rendering based on the current tab value. Plus, I'll implement the appropriate server endpoints while protecting them with middleware.</details></think>

---

I'll add a new admin "系统设置" module end-to-end: database schema and helpers, admin/public APIs, a new `AdminSystemSettings.vue` form, add it to the sidebar and mobile drawer, and render it in `pages/admin.vue`. Then I'll wire default layout to use site settings for brand/title/favicon.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating admin.vue**

I need to modify admin.vue to include AdminSystemSettings and the necessary conditions. Plus, I'll add it to the imports. Also, it seems I need to update the default layout to use the site settings. The user requested a system settings page, and since we've already set up the APIs, component, and sidebar, it's time to wire admin.vue to render it. I’ll proceed with the patch carefully, applying the changes in the correct order.</details></think>

已为后台新增“系统设置”模块并串起来：
- 数据库：在 `server/utils/db.ts` 新增 `site_settings` 表与 `getSiteSettings`、`updateSiteSettings`。
- 接口：
  - 管理端：`/api/admin/site` GET/PUT
  - 公共端：`/api/site` GET
- 组件：新增 `components/AdminSystemSettings.vue`，可编辑站点标题/副标题/介绍/Logo/Favicon。
- 导航：在 `layouts/admin.vue` 侧边栏与抽屉加入“系统设置”入口。
- 页面：`pages/admin.vue` 支持 `tab=system` 显示该表单。
- 默认布局：`layouts/default.vue` 读取 `/api/site`，自动设置页面 title、description 和 favicon。

你现在可在后台“系统设置”中修改站点信息，保存后主页的标题、描述、图标会更新。

顶部导航栏的左侧
<a class="brand" href="/">Minecraft 服务器</a>
应该改成logo

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating brand logo link**

I need to update the brand link in layouts/default.vue to display the logo image from site settings. We already load the logo_url from siteSettings, so I’ll replace the text with an img tag if available and set the alt attribute to site_title. I’ll ensure the styles are correct with brand as inline-flex and the image height set to around 28. I might also need to consider updating the admin layout brand next. First, I’ll read the file content to make the necessary modifications.</details></think>

已将主页顶部导航左侧由文字改为 Logo：
- 若系统设置中有 `logo_url`，显示该图片；否则回退显示文字“Minecraft 服务器”。
- 保持左贴齐，右侧导航与主题按钮贴右。

已参考 KukeMC 的落地风格将首页 hero 优化为全屏显示，并改进可读性与移动端表现：
- hero 改为全屏高度 100svh，桌面端使用轻微的 fixed 视差；移动端自动降级为 scroll。
- 增加顶部到底部的柔和渐变覆盖，提升标题/副标题对比度。
- 标题/副标题采用响应式字号，按钮组自适应换行。
